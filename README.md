# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA

# What is Topic Modelling?
In my words Topic Modelling is the process of extracting major themes from a given corpus of text data.
 
# Wikipedia Definition
In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.

# Usage
In the age of information, the amount of the written material we encounter each day is simply beyond our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies.
Originally developed as a text-mining tool, topic models have also been used to detect instructive structures in data such as genetic information, images, and networks.

# History
Original technique for topic modelling was developed in 1998 by Raghavan, Tamaki and Vempala. Then came the PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) in 1998 created by Thomas Hoffman.
Most commonly used technique called the LDA (Latent Drichilet Allocation) was developed in 2002 by Andrew Ng, David Blei and Michael Jordan. Another technique which is an extension of LDA is called the Pachinko Allocation and improves on LDA by modeling correlations between topics in addition to the word correlations which constitute topics.
An alternative to LDA is the HLTA (Heirarchical Latent Tree Analysis), which models word co-occurrence using a tree of latent variables and the states of the latent variables, which correspond to soft clusters of documents, are interpreted as topics.
